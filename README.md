### My Story
Some people dream of writing there own book, or starting there own blog,
I always wanted to develop my own game. This vacation I decided to make my dream come true.
In the beginning I was not sure where to start, which language to learn or
how to make sound or a simple game loop.
Then I heared about the 13kb challenge. The challenge had already started
but I decided to start anyway. And this was the best decision ever!

Enjoy playing "Bo the Dog"!
